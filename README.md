Ocean Data Platform Observability Models for the GSSI Multi-level Model Framework for Quality Evaluation of Systems (QES).

Particularly, we are working at the levels @1 and @0 of the specified multi-level model.


This work extends previous implementations of the refered framework [GSSI's Multi-level Model Framework for Quality Evaluation of Systems](https://github.com/gssi/SmartCityModeling), being the subject a platform that receives data from diferent monitored sites at sea.
