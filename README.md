# KPI Engine

Ocean Data Platform Observability Models for the GSSI Multi-level Model Framework for Quality Evaluation of Subjects.

Particularly, we are working at the levels @1 and @0 of the specified multi-level model.


In particular, this work extends previous implementations of the refered framework [GSSI's Multi-level Model Framework for Quality Evaluation of Subjects](https://github.com/gssi/SmartCityModeling), being the subject a platform that receives data from diferent monitored sites at sea.
