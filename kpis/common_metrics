    KP1:

        If CPU > 90%, scale-out by 1
        If Memory > 90%, scale-out by 1
        If CPU < 45%, scale-in by 1

        (alternative: check rate of change)
 
Dimension: Service Reliability
Category: Failure

    KPI1: Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)
    Description: MTBF measures the likelihood of a piece of equipment or component failure within a period, which allows one to quantify its reliability.
    Calculation: Total Operational Time / Total Number of Breakdowns = MTBF (hrs.)
    
    KPI2: Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)
    Description: MTTF measures the average operating time to failure for a non-repairable similar assets or components
    Calculation: Operating time to failure (in hours) / Number of Assets in Use
    
    KP3: Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)
    Description: MTTR measures the average time needed to restore an asset to its fully operational capabilities.
    Calculation: Total Repair Time (in hours) / Total Number of Failures.
